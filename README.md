# CV

==============

My cv, version 1! Build from scratch using the amazing power of
React.

## How it's built
I used React and pure css styling (css modules)...I may eventually create my own design system as I have gotten to love working with just css(pure css)


## The Design
I wanted something simple, and understandable with no UI systems yet...and fast-loading, of course.

## Future stuff
Right now I'm happy with the site, but I'd probably involve some design systems in the next version and of course rather have an API for my data and then fetch it, rathe than have hardcoded things :)
